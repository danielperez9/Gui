# Gui
practice Gui project
in this Branch there are a few user interface i have attempted at i hvae attempted using the tkinter and pygame and although not finding a prefernce since they both have thier pros and cons I have tried to implement both  on some of the files to see if they could help make one GUI.

I have also uploaded a GUI that I have tried designed from c# but have not yet been able to run differnt types of code from it. I have been looking at other methods in which one can implement python, such as the use of ironpython but ave not had much luck.
